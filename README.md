# What is this?

This program inputs the HTML file of a Netlix liked list on desktop, and outputs the names of each liked item as a simple list. This program exists so that when you want a list of all your Netflix items, you don't have to write them all out in a text document or on paper.

# Installation

## Installing through Git

```
git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/Netflix-liked-items
cd Netflix-liked-items
```

# Usage

To run this, it's just like any other Python program:

```
python3 netflix_list.py <optional: Path to file>
```

If the path to the HTML file is not given in the command line, it will automatically ask for it.
